# Installation

Kefir available as NPM and Bower packages, as well as simple files download.

### NPM
```sh
npm install kefir
```

### Bower
```sh
bower install kefir
```

### Download

See [downloads](https://kefirjs.github.io/kefir/#downloads) section in the docs.

# Browsers support

We don't support IE8 and below, aside from that Kefir should work in any browser.


## [Flow](https://flowtype.org/)

The NPM package ships with Flow definitions. So you can do something like this if you use Flow:

```js
// @flow

import Kefir from 'kefir'

function foo(numberStream: Kefir.Observable<number>) {
  numberStream.onValue(x => {
    // Flow knows x is a number here
  });
}

const s = Kefir.constant(5);
// Flow can automatically infer the type of values in the stream and determine
// that `s` is of type Kefir.Observable<number> here.
foo(s);
```

# Development

```sh
npm run prettify    # makes source code pretty (you must run it before a PR could be merged)
npm run build-js    # builds js bundlers
npm run test        # runs all the checks
npm run test-only   # runs only unit tests without other checks
npm run test-debug  # runs tests with a chrome inspector connected to the node process
npm run build-docs  # builds the documentation html file
```

If you don't have Node.js installed on your system and you're using Docker, then you can run the commands above using docker-compose:

```
docker-compose build                # Build the docker image
docker-compose run app npm install  # Install the npm libraries

docker-compose run app npm run prettify
docker-compose run app npm run ...
```
